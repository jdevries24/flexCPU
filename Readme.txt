This is just a somewhat basic CPU and assembler. The assembler is codded using python.
The CPU is designed using logisim. The CPU is a simple load store design. Varibles are taken out of
Memory modified then put back. More through documentation maybe on its way. However there may be a diffrent
version I wish to work on.
